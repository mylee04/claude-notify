# 🚀 Claude-Notify Development Journey

## Project Overview
**Claude-Notify** - A Homebrew-installable tool that provides native macOS notifications for Claude Code, making it easy to know when tasks complete, errors occur, or input is needed.

## 📅 Development Timeline

### Day 1 - Initial Concept & Evolution

#### 1. **Initial Request** (Simple Notification Setup)
**User Need**: "I want to setup this cursor notifier to send me notification on my macOS from here when you have done my query or failed"

**First Implementation**: 
- Created basic notification script in project directory
- Used AppleScript for notifications
- Simple on/off functionality

**Challenges**:
- ❌ Only worked for single project
- ❌ Manual setup required
- ❌ No easy toggle mechanism

#### 2. **Evolution to Global System**
**Enhancement**: User wanted notifications for multiple projects

**Solution**:
- Moved scripts to `~/.claude/notifications/`
- Created global toggle system
- Added project-name detection

**Key Learning**: Users often work on multiple projects simultaneously

#### 3. **Adding Project-Specific Controls**
**User Request**: "May I make a setup that enables notification setup for project by project too?"

**Implementation**:
- Hybrid system: global + project-specific
- Project settings override global settings
- `.claude/hooks.json` in project directories

**Architecture Decision**: Check project hooks first, then fall back to global

#### 4. **The Homebrew Idea** 💡
**Breakthrough**: "What about building a library so that users simply download this using pip or npm or brew"

**Decision Process**:
- Considered npm (❌ requires Node.js)
- Considered pip (❌ not ideal for shell scripts)
- **Chose Homebrew** (✅ perfect for macOS tools)

**Benefits Identified**:
- One-line installation
- Automatic dependency management
- Easy updates
- No PATH configuration needed

└── test/                      # Tests
```

### Command Design
```bash
# Dual command system for flexibility
claude-notify on    OR    cn on
claude-notify off   OR    cn off
claude-notify status OR   cn status

# Project commands
claude-notify project on    OR    cnp on
claude-notify project off   OR    cnp off
```

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### 1. **Single Executable Pattern**
- One script detects how it was called (claude-notify/cn/cnp)
- Reduces code duplication
- Easier maintenance

### 2. **Hook-Based Integration**
- Uses Claude Code's existing hook system
- Non-invasive - doesn't modify Claude Code
- Easy to enable/disable

### 3. **Notification Methods**
1. **Primary**: terminal-notifier (best experience)
2. **Fallback**: osascript (always available on macOS)
3. **Future**: Linux (libnotify), Windows (BurntToast)

### 4. **Configuration Storage**
- Global: `~/.claude/hooks.json`
- Project: `.claude/hooks.json`
- Preferences: `~/.config/claude-notify/`

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### Smart Detection
- Auto-detects Claude Code installation
- Finds terminal-notifier if installed
- Identifies current project name
- Detects user's shell for completions

### User Experience
- Colorful output with emojis
- Clear error messages with solutions
- Test command for verification
- Setup wizard for first-time users

### Flexibility
- Works globally or per-project
- Easy on/off toggles
- Both long and short commands
- Shell completions for all variants

## 📝 Lessons Learned

1. **Start Simple, Iterate**: Basic script → Global system → Project controls → Package manager
2. **User Convenience Matters**: Aliases (cn/cnp) make daily use much easier
3. **Fallbacks are Important**: Not everyone has terminal-notifier installed
4. **Documentation is Key**: Clear instructions prevent support issues

## 🚧 Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Command Name Conflicts
**Problem**: How to support both `claude-notify` and `cn` without duplicating code?
**Solution**: Single executable with symlinks, detect calling name

### Challenge 2: Finding Claude Code
**Problem**: Claude Code installation location varies
**Solution**: Check multiple common locations, provide manual override

### Challenge 3: Shell Compatibility
**Problem**: Different shells have different syntax
**Solution**: Separate completion files for bash/zsh/fish

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

1. **Cross-Platform Support**
   - Linux: Use notify-send/libnotify
   - Windows: PowerShell with BurntToast
   
2. **Advanced Features**
   - Custom notification sounds
   - Notification history/logs
   - Integration with other tools
   
3. **Distribution**
   - Homebrew tap for easy installation
   - AUR package for Arch Linux
   - Chocolatey for Windows

## 🎉 Current Status

- ✅ Core functionality complete
- ✅ Dual command system working
- ✅ Project structure established
- 🔄 Creating Homebrew formula
- 📋 Writing documentation
- 📋 Adding shell completions
- 📋 Setting up GitHub repository

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Evolution is Natural**: Projects rarely end up exactly as initially conceived
2. **User Feedback Drives Innovation**: Each request led to better architecture
3. **Simplicity Wins**: `brew install` → `cn on` is unbeatable UX
4. **Community Tools Need Polish**: Professional packaging encourages adoption
